## Introduction

Welcome to the home page of Tom Ridge. I am currently working for altodata on
various projects for the rail industry, using AWS technologies mostly (Lambda,
CloudFormation, RDS (PostgreSQL), SNS, SQS etc.) and Python.

I was a Senior Lecturer at the University of Leicester up to July 2021. From
August 2021 till March 2023 I worked for OCamlLabs/Tarides on various projects
(some involving Tezos and blockchain technologies).
