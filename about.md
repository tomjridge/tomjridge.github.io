background is in formal methods and theorem proving. His research has
mainly focused on applications of formal methods to real-world
systems. 

He worked at Cambridge on the NetSem project giving a formal semantics
to TCP/IP, and briefly on relaxed memory models. Recently he has
worked on verified parsing. Currently he is working on a verified file
system.
