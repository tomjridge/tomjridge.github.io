			<h3>About open source</h3>

			<p>Open source software is primarily a response to the software
			crisis that was apparent in second half of the 20th
			century. Software was incredibly expensive to develop, took a
			long time to develop, and was often of poor quality. Open source
			software is typically distributed as source code, which allows
			other people to take the software and improve it. This engenders
			a community of sharing amongst IT people. The quality of open
			source software can be (and often is) superior to commercial
			software. The availability of many open-source software
			components makes software development much easier, since
			developers have a library of ready-made components which they
			can use. This massively decreases the cost of software, and the
			time to develop it.</p>

			<h3>How open source can help your business</h3>
			<p>Quite simply, most businesses could benefit by using open source software.</p>
			<ul class="square">
				<li><strong>Freely available</strong>: Open source software is
				often freely available, which substantially reduces the total lifetime cost of such systems. </li>
				<li><strong>High quality</strong>: Although a lot of open
				source software consists of hobby code written by amateurs for
				fun, a significant number of open source applications are
				serious, heavyweight players in their market segments, with
				extremely high-quality code, and often supported by major
				companies with substantial amounts of money invested</li>
			</ul>
      <p>Examples of significant open source software used in business are:</p>
			<ul class="square">
        <li><strong>Linux</strong>: The extremely successful operating system which now underpins companies such as Amazon and Google.</li>
				<li><strong>SugarCRM</strong>: A very powerful and easy to use customer relationship management application.</li>
				<li><strong>MySQL and PostgreSQL</strong>: Well-known, high-performance database engines.</li>
			</ul>
