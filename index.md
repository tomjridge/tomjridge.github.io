## Introduction

Welcome to the home page of Tom Ridge. I am currently working for
OCamlLabs/Tarides on various projects (some involving Tezos and
blockchain technologies).

I was a Senior Lecturer at the University of Leicester up to
July 2021. Regarding Leicester, I am limited by an NDA as to what I
can say. However, I would encourage everyone to observe the
[International Boycott of Leicester
University](https://www.ucu.org.uk/supportTheLeicesterBoycott).
