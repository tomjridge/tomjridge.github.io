# SibylFS

## SibylFS

SibylFS is a filesystem test oracle which can take traces of 
filesystem behaviour (observed at the libc interface) and determine whether
they conform to POSIX (or Linux, or Mac OS X) behaviour. The oracle is based
on a specification which is in some sense a formal, mechanized version of 
(parts of) the 
POSIX specification.
